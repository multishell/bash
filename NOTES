Platform-Specific Configuration Notes
=====================================

1.  configure --without-gnu-malloc on:

	alpha running OSF/1
	alpha running Linux

	next running NeXT/OS

	all machines running SunOS YP code: SunOS4, SunOS5, HP/UX

	linux (optional)

	QNX 4.2
	other OSF/1 machines (KSR/1, HP, IBM AIX/ESA)
	AIX
	sparc SVR4, SVR4.2 (ICL reference port)
	DG/UX
	Cray

	NetBSD/sparc (malloc needs 8-byte alignment; GNU malloc has 4-byte)

	BSD/OS 2.1 if you want to use loadable builtins

	If you are using GNU libc, especially on a linux system

(Configuring --without-gnu-malloc will still result in lib/malloc/libmalloc.a
being built and linked against, but there is only a stub file in the archive.)

2.  configure using shlicc on BSD/OS 2.1 to use loadable builtins

3.  Bash cannot be built in a directory separate from the source directory
    using configure --srcdir=... unless the version of `make' you're using
    does $VPATH handling right.  The SunOS make, for one, does not seem to
    do it right.  The script support/mkclone can be used to create a
    `build tree' using symlinks to get around this.

4.  I've had reports that username completion does not work on IRIX 5.3
    when linking with -lnsl.  This is only a problem when you're running
    NIS.  Editing the Makefile after configure runs and removing the
    `-lnsl' from the assignment to `LIBS' fixes the problem.
